* Horizon j5 DMC(Dynamic Memory Controller) device

Required properties:
- compatible:		 Must be "hobot,j5-dmc".
- devfreq-events:	 Node to get DDR loading, Refer to
			 Documentation/devicetree/bindings/devfreq/
			 rockchip-dfi.txt
- clocks:		 Phandles for clock specified in "clock-names" property
- clock-names :		 The name of clock used by the DFI, must be
			 "pclk_ddr_mon";
- operating-points-v2:	 Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/opp.txt
			 for details.
- status:		 Marks the node enabled/disabled.

Following properties are ddr timing:

Example:
	dmc_opp_table: dmc_opp_table {
		compatible = "operating-points-v2";

		opp00 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <300000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <900000>;
		};
		opp01 {
			opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <666000000>;
			opp-microvolt = <900000>;
		};
	};

	dmc: dmc {
		compatible = "hobot,j5-dmc";
		devfreq-events = <&dfi>;
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_DDRCLK>;
		clock-names = "dmc_clk";
		operating-points-v2 = <&dmc_opp_table>;
	};
